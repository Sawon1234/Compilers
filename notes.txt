Discussion partners:
Minor discussion with Matthew Lorring and Andrew Demaio

Division of labor:
Dominick did (stole from rest of team) bulk of the work, with Deedy and Simon amply contributing on all parts. Bryce wrote test cases. 

Notes:
This submission includes the pcollections library, which, while being extremely useful, may not be on the appropriate classpath. 

We will probably resubmit tomorrow


Also, ANTLR might print errors...we do not know how to surpress them
