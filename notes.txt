Division of labor:
Dominick worked with the CFG and garbage collector
Simon implemented all of CSE
Bryce worked on the testing framework
Deedy worked on fixing PA4

Notes:
We include the pcollections library in much the same way we include ANTLR

Our CSE should be well functioning and has the most dramatic results.
For LVA we use a CFG to do dead code removal and unreachable code removal

for example:

a := 1; <- optimized out
a := 2;
return [""]
f := do_stuff(); <- unreachable, removed

We do not use the CFG to do garbage collection as we had too much trouble with it.
Instead we implement the best "safe" collector we can, and then remove everything else 
at the end of the program. 

that is

a := b;
...
a := c; (c gains a reference and b loses a reference)
...
free_all_the_things();

We got to the point where implementing unboxing would introduce more bugs than it is worth.
