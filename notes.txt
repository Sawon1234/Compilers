Discussion partners:
Minor discussion with Matthew Lorring and Andrew Demaio

Division of labor:
Dominick did (stole from rest of team) bulk of the work. Simon paired with Dominick, was initial implementor for statements and expressions, and was master bug catcher. Deedy ran special operations such as the join algorithm, fixed errors with the parser, and was the theory guru (tasked with deep understanding of the spec). Bryce wrote test cases.

Notes:
We include the pcollections library in much the same way we include ANTLR
